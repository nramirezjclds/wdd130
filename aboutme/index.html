    <p>Greetings from Texas. I'm very excited about taking this class 
    and getting to know some of you. I've been married for over 2 
    years now and my wife and I have 5 month old son. I've been a 
    member of the church my entire life and have served in many 
    callings. We also have a dog named Nyx, although I'm not too 
    sure what breed she is. I had the opportunity of serving a full
    time mission in Canada. It was such an amazing experience.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include changing diapers, peek-a-boo, movies, video
        games, checking out the local cuisine, and anything tech
        related. My favorite scripture would have to be James 1:5.
        Not only was this the verse that inspired Joseph Smith to
        humble ask our Father in Heaven for guidance, but it also
        shows the relationship our Heavenly Father wants for us.
        If we lack anything, especially things pertaining to knowledge
        or spirituality, He and His Son Jesus Christ, are there
        to give liberally. But only if we ask in faith. If we can
        exercise even a small particle of faith. God can work miracles.</p>
