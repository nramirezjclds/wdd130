      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This last winter in Texas was one of the worst experiences our state has ever experienced. Thousands were left without food, water, and power due to ice storms and sever winter weather. Power grids went down due to overuse and poor management. Food shortages occured at local grocery stores since the public was in a panic and delivery trucks were halted because of icy roads. People were starving and freezing in their own homes. It is our intention to build an online community that discusses the imortance of food supply and emergency preparedness kits. This page will have information on the best products available, as well as blogs for communication, response times, testimonials, and a support system for those affected. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>We invite all who wish to make a difference in our great state to like and share our services. We also want to invite our local community leadership to take part in the discussion, including our state representatives. We're all brothers and sisters in this beautiful world- it's our sacred duty to look after one another. If one of us is suffering, we all suffer. With one heart and one mind, we can ensure that our fellow man's suffering can be put at ease. Gather, give, and uplift those who have lost their livlihood from this past traumatic experience. Be the change you wish to see in the world. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Food Supply</h3>
      <p>
        Having an up to date food supply can sometimes be the difference between life and death. It's all about PREPARATION! PREPARATION! PREPARATION! What kinds of foods are great to keep on hand? How often should you switch out your food? What are some good labeling and organizational practices? How will you cook when the power goes out? These are the questions I had when I first started building my food supply and it all seemed overwhelming. The task seemed too large and the problem too big. Then I thought of my wife and infant son. What would happen to them if our food source were cut off for a week? Two weeks? This posed an even greater obstacle to climb, one I hoped I would never have to endure. So I took things one day at a time, block by block and brick by brick.</p>
        <p>The best place to keep food storage, in my opinion, is somewhere dry and cool. This can be your basement, closet, under the bed, or your pantry. This can help keep food from spoiling, ensuring it lasts longer. You're going to want to stock up on lots of dried foods such as rice, oatmeal, pasta, flour, grains, or dried beans. I would next advise canned goods, but these can have a shorter shelf life, so it's important to keep track of expiration dates and switch out foods that are about to go bad. </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Emergency Kits</h3>
      <p>
        When I have a fully stocked emergency kit, I tend to sleep a little better at night. My mind is at ease knowing I have a medical response for "most" accidents or injuries that can occur at home. These can have the following items: bandages, gauze, tape, antiseptics, antibiotics, sutures, scissors, pain relievers, anti-burn cream, latex gloves, masks, clean distilled water, blankets, matches, needle and syringe, flashlight, whistle, map, or hand radio. If you have any medications, it would be wise to include some extra doses if anything happens. For example, if you're diabetic, try to have extra insulin available.</p>
        <p>In my house, every person has a 48-hour bag available. This can include extra clothes, food (but no perishables), money, medicine, a toothbrush, family photo, flashlight, medical kit, and instructions on where to go and what to do should an emergency force us to flee from our home. We discuss beforehand where to go if we should happen to get separated. It's better to prepare and talk about your options to avoid potential chaos. What do you have in your emergency kit? </p>
